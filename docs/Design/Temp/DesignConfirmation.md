# Design confirmation


### Key issues

- [ ] Design elements and sequence - [Design Overview](docs/DesignOverview.md)
- [ ] Can we use nested classes? (they seem to have the least impact on the implementing apps API)
- [ ] Name of Args class (Args class, Command class, Command DTO, something else)
  - This reflects how we talk about the class and the base class name only
- [ ] Name of DataDefinition class (DataDefinition CommandDefinition, something else)
- [ ] Managing constructor conflicts with a user constructor

### Other issues

- [ ] Validation
- [ ] NRT warnings in constructor (#48)
- [ ] Options that execute (#31)
